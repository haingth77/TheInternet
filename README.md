This is a study project where I start my learning about Selenium with TestNG written in Java. Specifically, it includes basic knowledge of Selenium: locator, actions with website, implicit and explicit wait, input data with csv file,... 
Almost test classes in this project test the website "https://the-internet.herokuapp.com". Moreover, after tests work correctly, they have been transferred into Page Object Model to utilize as a simple domain specific language.
